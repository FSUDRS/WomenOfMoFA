## A Note From the Curators

Gender disparity can be seen in different areas of our society; including in art museums all across the globe. With the [United States Census recording over 50% of the United State population as female](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=United%20States&table=DP05&tid=ACSDP1Y2017.DP05&lastDisplayedRow=29&vintage=2017&layer=state&cid=DP05_0001E), our museum collections should reflect that. According to the [National Museum of Women in the Arts](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/gallery-representation-dwindles-for-more-established-female-artists-new-research-finds), in a study of 820,000 exhibitions across the public and commercial sectors in 2018, only one third were by women artists. In a study conducted by mathematicians, statisticians, and art historians at Williams College, the United States’ art museum sector is grappling with diversity. [The study] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6426178/) showed that 18 major museums in the United States are 85% white and 87% male within the permanent collections. [At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for instance, less than 3% of the artists in the modern sections are women, but 83% of nudes are of women.](file:///Users/Steph/Downloads/Betsch%20Cole%20Museums,%20Diversity%20and%20Social%20Value%20(1).pdf) [_The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation: Art Museum Staff Demographic survey_](file:///Users/Steph/Downloads/awmf_museum_diversity_report_aamd_7-28-15%20(1).pdf) states, >“the case is clear and urgent, and constructive responses to it will be critical to the continued vitality of art museums as public resources for a democratic society.”

However, more and more recently, we have seen curators who are creating spaces that push dialogue of hard truths and activism within their communities in order to provide a platform for minority artists who have been pushed to the side and ignored. [These curators are people who are stretching in exciting, innovative, and creative ways in what curatorial work actually is and can be.](https://www.aam-us.org/2020/01/08/curators-take-flight-four-curators-cast-a-wide-eye-on-the-shifting-landscape-for-curatorial-practice/) Inspired by the curators who stand before us and activism groups such as the [Guerilla Girls](https://www.guerrillagirls.com/), who provide a platform for these hard truths and realities, we have created an exhibition that provides a platform for female artists, those of the minority, who have been stripped of their artistic voice. Our particular exhibition uses pieces of the permanent collection at Florida State University’s Museum of Fine Arts (MoFA). These pieces were selected after careful statistical research that showed only 8% of the works in the museum’s permanent collection were by female artists.

Because the MoFA is a university housed institution, it faces many obstacles when it comes to funding and acquisition of new works of art. With a small acquisition budget, many of the works within the permanent collection are donations from individuals within the Florida State community such as recent graduates from BFA and MFA programs. The institution’s acquisition guidelines outline that recommendations for purchase and gifts will be considered for acquisition if they meet _one_ of the following requirements:
* Objects are of instructional value consonant with the Museum’s mission and intended for academic study or research.
* The purchase/gift has a valid connection with the Museum’s conscious effort to preserve the history of artists in this geographical region, especially faculty artists.
* The objects relate to exhibitions organized by the Museum in its efforts to present programs of excellence and observe equity.
* Objects are of aesthetic excellence.

Whether or not an object meets these requirements is up to the faculty within the College of Fine Arts (Art History, Department of Art) alongside the Museum staff, and relevant department heads from the Advisory Council. Senior Registrar and Collections Manager, Jean Young, has worked as the Collections Manager for over 20 years and has observed the nature of the acquisition process. Young speaks on the expansion of the collection, “Due to storage issues, the Museum currently has no plans to extensively expand their collection, with the possible exception of outstanding works offered as a donation or works that correspond to a curated exhibition at the Museum.”

The acquisition guideline also states, ”The Museum of Fine Arts is empowered by its mission statement to collect the widest possible range of high quality works of art from the most ancient to the most avant-garde, from all the world’s cultures past and present in all visual arts media. Notwithstanding the broad collection objective, for the time being, resources will be allocated to artworks that build upon current Permanent Collection strengths.”

Due to the lack of gender diversity within the MoFA’s permanent collection, we have outlined a number of ideas the museum can work towards.

We do, however, recognize the lack of resources the MoFA faces, but we believe that even with lack of resources, there are improvements that can be made. We encourage the museum to diversify their institution in a variety of ways, but one being to acknowledge their own gender gap within the permanent collection. We believe that providing the statistics of how many works in the collection are attributed to women is extremely important as it aids us in a quest to prove why these women deserve a platform. Other ways the museum can improve is to provide a diversity clause that details the museums views on gender disparity, provide information detailing about their particular accession process, fundraise for works by female artists, and encourage the female students within the BFA and MFA programs at Florida State.
